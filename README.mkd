The data in FpetWasp_Data.csv are derived from syconia (enclosed inflorescences) collected between 2007-2013 from multiple Ficus petiolaris trees along a broad latitudinal gradient in Baja, Mexico. Data collected include multiple estimates of tree connectivity. They also include per syconium counts of foundress pollinators, pollinator offspring, associated species of nonpollinators, and seeds. Syconia volumes and tree latitudes are also included (note that syconia volumes are estimated from the mean of three ruler estimates of fruit diameter in mm and the formula for a sphere).

The file FpetWasp_Analysis.R recreates the entire analysis of Duthie and Nason (2016) in R, including analysis of the appendix, using the file `FpetWasp_Data.csv'. It also recreates all figures used in the manuscript. More detailed explanations are included in the comments of this file. Original records of syconia measurements are in the 'field_syconia' folder. Photos from this trip can be found [in this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/2cmwnkdxd6m6g88/AADed_Y8mMnsRD8HmAi591nLa?dl=0).
